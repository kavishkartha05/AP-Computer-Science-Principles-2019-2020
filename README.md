# AP-Computer-Science-Principles-2019-2020
I self-studied AP Computer Science Principles during the 2019-2020 academic year. However, due to the closure of schools as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the College Board decided to cancel the in-person multiple choice exam for AP Computer Science Principles, and based the scores solely on the Explore and Create Tasks.
